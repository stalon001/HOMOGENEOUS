# HOMOGENEOUS
Homogenous Random Forest  is a powerful machine learning algorithm for both classification and regression tasks.
It is a type of ensemble learning algorithm, which combines multiple decision trees to create a more powerful and accurate model. 
it works by creating a large number of decision trees, each of which is trained on a randomly selected subset of the available data.
The trees are then combined to create a single, more powerful model. 
This model is then used to make predictions on unseen data.
it can also be used for handling missing data
this model also handle categorical data
